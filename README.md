# SimpleIniParser

A library for the Nintendo Switch to be able to easily parse, modify, and create INI files. The main reason this library was written was due to the special needs of the hekate ini file. The hekate ini file can have the same key used multiple times within the same section, and its captions surrounded by curly braces. As these are outside the ini standard, other ini parsers would remove the duplicate keys and strip out the captions.

## Installation

To install the latest release run the following:

```bash
makepkg -si
```

To build from source run the following:

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

I've included multiple examples for editing, creating, and reading ini files. You can find them under the example folder. Remember to add `-lSimpleIniParser` to `LIBS` in your makefile.
